Hi, I'm JoÃ£o Victor, and I've been coding a lot since 2020 ðŸ˜„.

Currently, I'm a Full-stack developer, with occasional DevOps experiments. My expertise is in Node.js and React, but I've also worked with Go, Python, Meteor.js, and recently developed an interest in Ruby on Rails.

Feel free to reach out, especially if you have a good book recommendation! :)
