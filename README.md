Hi, I'm João Victor

Software engineer with experience building and evolving production systems, mainly within the Meteor.js ecosystem.

Background in Node.js and React, with hands-on experience in payments and billing systems, system rewrites, and legacy migrations. I usually work end-to-end, from architecture and implementation to production, with a strong sense of ownership.

I care deeply about readable, maintainable code, clear communication, and continuous alignment between technical decisions and real business needs. I aim to balance quality and speed while building reliable software that creates long-term value.

### Tech stack
- Node.js
- Meteor.js
- React
- MongoDB
- SQL
