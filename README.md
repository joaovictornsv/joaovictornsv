Hi, I'm JoÃ£o Victor and since 2020 I've been coding a lot ðŸ˜„.

Currently, I'm a Full-stack developer, and sometimes I play with some DevOps stuff.
My experience is focused on Node.js + React, but I have worked with Go, Python, Meteor.js and most recently I'm interested in Ruby on Rails.

Feel free to get in touch, mainly to recommend a good book :)
